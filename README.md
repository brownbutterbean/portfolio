weights_program: the program will calculate a weight for each household and age/gender group, and then assign it to each survey respondent.

systematic_sampling: provided with sorting criteria and a sample size, will systematically select a sample and provide distrubtions and frequency for quality checks.

k-means: the program will look for patterns in a dataset based on supplied characteristics ("charc") and number of clusters. It will create a 2-dimensional mapping of the clusters around the centroids.
